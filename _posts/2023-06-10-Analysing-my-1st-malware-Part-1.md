### Disclaimer

I am just a beginner in malware analysis, I'm writing this blogpost to help others and because
it's good practice, I always tell myself that if I can't explain something, then I
do not really understand it.


If you want to follow along, you can download the sample on [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/4eb33ce768def8f7db79ef935aabf1c712f78974237e96889e1be3ced0d7e619/)

## Introduction

Hi ! Today I am going to start reverse engineering my first malware ! Let me introduce you to 
`Hamweq`, a malware categorized as an `IRC Botnet`. You can find more about our friend by 
looking up its SHA256 hash `4eb33ce768def8f7db79ef935aabf1c712f78974237e96889e1be3ced0d7e619`

Let's load the binary directly into IDA and get our hands dirty !

## First glance from IDA

The binary is 32-bit windows executable, looking at the different IDA tables, we can see that it has very few functions, imports, and only a few unobfuscated strings.
