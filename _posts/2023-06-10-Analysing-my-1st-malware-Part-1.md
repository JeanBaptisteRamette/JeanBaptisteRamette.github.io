### Disclaimer
I am just a beginner in malware analysis, I'm writing this blogpost to help others and because
it's good practice, I always tell myself that if I can't explain something, then I
do not really understand it.

Hi ! Today I am going to start reverse engineering my first malware ! Let me introduce you to 
`Hamweq`, a malware categorized as an `IRC Botnet`. You can find more about our friend by 
looking up its SHA256 hash `4eb33ce768def8f7db79ef935aabf1c712f78974237e96889e1be3ced0d7e619`
